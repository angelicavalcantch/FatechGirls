Mini-course: Creating a website from scratch with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

The 'FatechGirls' meeting  happened at the FATEC (College of Technology in São Paulo) and it was presented the overall use and some features of Bootstrap. Most of the attendees were beginners and we were able to create a single page using HTML, CSS and of course, Bootstrap.
